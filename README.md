# GITHUB-SEARCH-API


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

# DESCRIPTION

This is a **Github Search** application that searches for user and displays their profile info using the ***Github API.***

This is a website where users may enter a GitHub username into a form, submit it, and see names and descriptions of that person's public repositories. 

GitHub API was used to retrieve this information. This API allows ***5,000*** requests per hour with an API key, but only 60 requests per hour _without_ one.
